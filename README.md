# FDP - Understanding Depression through XAI
Tamara Pérez Pérez

This project focuses on understanding factors linked to depression through the 
application of artificial intelligence (AI) and Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. 
Using the dataset from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES), models such as Decision Tree and Explainable Boosting were 
employed to explore relationships between variables. The implementation of XAI 
techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, on a Random Forest model, allowed for a 
detailed and extensible understanding of the results.

Among the notable findings, sleep disorders were identified as a significant 
indicator of depression. Additionally, demographic patterns and blood biomarkers 
related to the prevalence of depression were observed. Lifestyle factors, 
including physical activity and nutrition, also demonstrated an impact on mental 
health.

However, the inequality in the dataset and the potential neglect by individuals to 
share information about their mental health arose significant challenges. A closer 
collaboration with mental health professionals is suggested to improve 
measurement validity. 

As a future line of work, an exclusive study on the relationship between nutrition 
and depression is proposed, taking advantage of the detailed data available in 
NHANES. This project highlights the importance of addressing the complexity of 
depression from various perspectives, integrating advancements in artificial 
intelligence with an understandable and explanatory approach.
